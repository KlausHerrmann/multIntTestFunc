# multIntTestFunc
The package provides implementations of test functions for multivariate numerical integration that can be used to test multivariate integration routines.
The package covers five different integration domains (unit hypercube, unit ball, unit sphere, standard simplex and R^n).
For each domain several functions with different properties (smooth, non-differentiable, ...) are available. The functions are available in all dimensions n >= 1.
For each function the exact value of the integral is known and implemented to allow testing the accuracy of multivariate integration routines.
Details on the test functions and the value of their integral can be found in <a href="documentation_test_functions.pdf">documentation_test_functions.pdf</a>.
